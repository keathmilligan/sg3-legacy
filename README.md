Cross-platform pure C OpenGL 3D scene management library

This is an old project that provides OpenGL scene and object management functionality. The goal was to provide a native core graphics
library that would run on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS. It is written in C and provides compatibility wrappers around the
OpenGL APIs to account for platform differences.
